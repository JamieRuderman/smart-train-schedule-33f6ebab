## 📱 Usage

1. **Select Your Route**: Choose your departure and arrival stations from the dropdown menus

6. **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light, dark, and system themes using the theme toggle at the bottom of the page

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses SMART's official brand colors:
- **SMART Green**: `#114533` - Primary brand color
- **SMART Gold**: `#E48E25` - Secondary accent color

The application supports both light and dark themes:
- **Light Theme**: Clean, bright interface optimized for daytime use
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes for nighttime viewing
- **System Theme**: Automatically matches your device's theme preference

The design follows modern web standards with:
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrast ratios
- Responsive breakpoints for all device sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions

## 📊 Data Structure

Train schedule data is organized by:
- **Stations**: 14 stations from Windsor to Larkspur
- **Directions**: Northbound and Southbound
- **Schedule Types**: Weekday and Weekend/Holiday
- **Ferry Connections**: Integrated Larkspur-San Francisco ferry schedules

## ⏱️ Timetable Updates

- Set the `TRANSIT_511_API_KEY` environment variable with your 511.org developer token (the updater automatically reads it from `.env`, `.env.local`, or your shell environment).
- Run `npm run update-transit` to download the latest SMART (`operator_id=SA`) and Golden Gate Ferry (`operator_id=GF`) GTFS feeds and rewrite the generated data under `src/data/generated/`.
- The `npm run update-build` script (ideal for Vercel builds) runs the update step before compiling so deployments stay in sync with the latest feeds.
- A ready-to-use GitHub Action lives at `.github/workflows/update-transit.yml`; add the `TRANSIT_511_API_KEY` repository secret and it will run weekly on the Hobby tier without additional cost.
- If you need more frequent updates later, you can add a Vercel Cron Job that hits a serverless function which triggers a redeploy, but the GitHub Action workflow keeps everything free today.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run update-build` - Update transit data then build (attach this to Vercel)
- `npm run update-transit` - Refresh schedules from the 511.org GTFS feeds
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
